# Simple Neural network (Just numpy)

Using neural network classify handwritten digit from MNIST dataset

- All process contains in `Simple_Neural_Network_Lab.ipynb`
- Neural network (Forward, Backward, Loss, Gradient) codes are provided in `neural_net.py` in cattern directory
- PCA implementation also can be found in `PCA.py`
