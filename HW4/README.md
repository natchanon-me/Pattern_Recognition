# Simple Neural network (Just numpy)

Using neural network classify handwritten digit from MNIST dataset

- `Simple_Neural_Network_Lab.ipynb` contains a step by step for utilizing neural network with MNIST dataset
- Neural network (Forward, Backward, Loss, Gradient) codes are implemented inside `neural_net.py` in [cattern](cattern/) directory
- PCA implementation also can be found in `PCA.py`
