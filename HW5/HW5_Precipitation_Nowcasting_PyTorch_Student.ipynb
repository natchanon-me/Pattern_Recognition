Your task is to predict the amount of rainfal in the center pixel. You will first do the prediction using just a simple fully-connected neural network that view each pixel as different input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the your input is basically an image, we will then view the input as an image and apply CNN to do the prediction. Finally, we can also add a time component since weather prediction can benefit greatly using previous time frames. Each data point actually contain 5 time steps, so each input data point has a size of 5x5x5x3 (time x height x width x channel), and the output data has a size of 5 (time). You will use this time information when you work with RNNs.\n",

    "To prepare a DataLoader in order to feed data into the model, we need to create a `torch.utils.data.Dataset` object first. (Learn more about it [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#map-style-datasets))\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset is a simple class that the DataLoader will get data from, most of its functionality comes from `__getitem__(self, index)` method, which will return a single data point (both input and label). In real world scenarios the method can do some other stuffs such as\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load images\n",
    "\n",
    "If your input (x) are images. Oftentimes you won't be able to fit all the training images into your RAM. Thus, you should pass an array (or list) of image path into the dataloader, and the `__getitem__` will be the one who dynamically loads the actual image from the harddisk for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Data normalization helps improve stability of training. Unnormalized data can cause gradients to explode. There are many variants of normalization, but in this notebook we will use either minmax or z-score (std) normalization. Read [this](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/data-prep/transform/normalization) (or google) if you wish to learn more about data normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer vision, you might want to apply small changes to the images you use in training (adjust brightness, contrast, rotation) so that the model will generalize better on unseen data. There are two kinds of augmentation: static and dynamic. Static augmentation will augment images and save to disk as a new dataset. On the other hand, rather than applying the change initially and use the same change on each image every epoch, dynamic augmentation will augment each data differently for each epoch. Note that augmentation is usually done on the CPU and you might be bounded by the CPU instead. PyTorch has a dedicated [documentation about data augmentation](https://pytorch.org/vision/master/transforms.html) if you want to know more."
